# Kubernetes Structure

## Logical Structure

![Kubernetes Folder Structure](/documentation/images/kubernetes-logical-structure.svg)

Each gate has the same base structure within kubernetes.
It has one frontgate, which communicates with the backgate, which in turn communicates with its own micro services as well as the core micro services.
Each service is represented by one deployment, which controls the pods generated by it.

## Folder Structure

![Kubernetes Folder Structure](/documentation/images/kubernetes-folder-structure.svg)

The `base` directory contains the basic necessary manifests for each deployment:

* `deployment.yml` defines the kubernetes deployment
* `kustomization.yml` collects all resources

Each service has a dedicated folder within the `service` directory to allow kustomization per-service.
The minimum kustomization shared by all services is:

* a unique `namePrefix` comprising of the gate and service
* labels indicating the gate and service
* an annotation to indicate the type of service
* the name of the image to use for this service

Each environment has its own folder within the `environment` folder.
Inside each environment, each service has yet another dedicated folder to allow per-environment kustomization.
The minimum kustomization shared by all environments is:

* the namespace belonging to that environment
