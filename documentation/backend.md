# Backend

This combines both backgates and microservices.
They are grouped by gate - meaning that each gate contains exactly one backgate, and multiple microservices.

## Backgate

Each backgate is a `django` project.
They get created through a [custom template](/templates/backend/backgate_template).

## Microservices

Each backgate is a `django` project.
They get created through a [custom template](/templates/backend/micro_template).
